For the last few years I've been using either Wordpress or (usually) Ghost for my blogs, and self-hosting them. I've posted a mix of content including home-brewing, fermentation projects, posts describing code projects on my Github, and even rants and reviews. Due to a few failures on my part with backups and migrations, mainly with the images and static content, my blog has ended up missing some content and isn't as clean as I'd like it to be. Also, a lot of the content feels dated or sub-par, I've grown a lot since I wrote much of the posts.

Since I'm not very happy with my current blog, and I'd be happier having one less server to maintain, I decided to switch back to Hugo to generate static site content so that I can leverage Github Pages for free hosting.
